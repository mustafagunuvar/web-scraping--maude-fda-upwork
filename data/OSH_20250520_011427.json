        "text": "THIS IS A COPY OF A LETTER DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED. DEAR SIR/MADAM, ON THE (B)(6) 2019 AT (B)(6) , MY SON (B)(6) UNDERWENT A SURGICAL PROCEDURE FOR THE CORRECTION OF A SCOLIOSIS CONDITION. I HAVE TRIED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS TO ENGAGE BOTH THE SUPPLIER AND THE MANUFACTURER TO DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENED, COMPENSATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IF THERE IS ANYTHING I SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT REGARDING MY SON'S FUTURE HEALTH. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT AND NOW THE MANUFACTURER IS DENYING LIABILITY. I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE OF THIS PRODUCT FAILURE. ON THE (B)(6) 2019 AT (B)(6), MY SON (B)(6) UNDERWENT A SURGICAL PROCEDURE FOR THE CORRECTION OF A SCOLIOSIS CONDITION. THE SURGERY WAS PERFORMED BY DR (B)(6) AND THE CONSTRUCT UTILIZED COMPONENTRY SUPPLIED BY YOUR COMPANY, NAMELY, THE \"ORTHO-PEDIATRICS\", \"RESPONSE\" SPINE SYSTEM. (B)(6) RECOVERY WAS HARD TO WATCH IN THAT HE WAS IN CONSIDERABLE PAIN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD, BECAME ANXIOUS AND WITHDRAWN AND DEVELOPED AN ADDICTION TO THE PAIN MEDICATION WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. DURING A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT AND X-RAYS OF THE ABOVE SURGERY, DR (B)(6) NOTED THAT THERE WAS SOME BROKEN COMPONENTRY AND ADVISED US THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO OPERATE A SECOND TIME TO CORRECT THE FAILED IMPLANTS. THIS ADVICE CAUSED (B)(6) EXTREME ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND MOOD SWINGS IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER PAIN AND SUFFERING. THE SECOND SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE (B)(6) 2019 ALSO AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE IMPLANTS REMOVED FORM (B)(6) BACK ARE BELOW. I ADVISE THE I HAVE THE IMPLANTS AND VIDEO OF THE 2ND SURGERY IN MY POSSESSION. BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE IMPLANTS, (B)(6) HAS - MISSED MORE SCHOOL DUE TO THE FURTHER EXTENDED CONVALESCENCE; EXPERIENCED FURTHER PAIN, SUFFERING AND A SECOND MEDICATION DEPENDENCY; LOST ALL OF THE INCOME FROM HIS PART TIME EMPLOYMENT AND HAS NOW BEEN ADVISED THAT HE HAS IN FACT BEEN TERMINATED FROM HIS PART TIME EMPLOYMENT; EXPERIENCED CONSIDERABLE MENTAL ANGUISH. AS RESULT OF (B)(6) SECOND SURGERY, MY WIFE AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED: SIGNIFICANT UNBUDGETED EXPENSES, INCLUDING FLIGHTS TO AND FROM (B)(6), ACCOMMODATION, MEALS AND TAXIS; MISSED WORK AND INCOME OPPORTUNITIES LEADING UP TO AND SUBSEQUENT TO (B)(6) SECOND SURGERY; COST OF MEDICATION, DRESSINGS. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REST OF THE IMPLANTS IN (B)(6) BACK AND WHETHER FURTHER FAILURES WILL OCCUR NECESSITATING MORE SURGERIES? I HAVE BECOME AWARE THAT SURGICAL SPECIALTIES KNEW OF ISSUES WITH THESE PRODUCTS, AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO CONSUMERS. PRIOR TO ENGAGING LEGAL REPRESENTATION, I INVITE YOU TO CONTACT US TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND TO NEGOTIATE AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT. FURTHER TO MY SUBMITTED FORM 35008 AND MY LETTER DESCRIBING THE EVENT, I FURTHER WRITE TO ADVISE THAT I HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH ORTHOPEDIATRICS FOR A YEAR TO TRY AND ESTABLISH THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHETHER THERE ARE FURTHER CONCERNS FOR MY SON'S HEALTH. ORTHOPEDIATRICS ASKED THAT I RETURN THE BROKEN PARTS TO THEM FOR THEIR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. I DID NOT RETURN THE PARTS TO THEM, ALTHOUGH I FORWARDED ALL THE NUMBERS ON THE PARTS. THEY SAID THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME AFTER THEIR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE. THEY HAVE ADVISED ME THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE BUT HAVE NOT PROVIDED ME WITH ANY DETAILS AT ALL. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR, I HAVE MADE REPEATED REQUESTS TO ORTHOPEDIATRICS AND THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL FOR - ASSURANCE THAT MY SON'S HEALTH IS NOT COMPROMISED BY THE IMPLANTS THAT REMAIN IN HIS BODY; EXPLANATION OF WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM; CERTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN MY SON'S SURGERY; A COPY OF THE RESULTS OF THEIR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE REQUESTS HAVE BEEN IGNORED. ALL CORRESPONDENCE IS AVAILABLE TO YOU SHOULD YOU REQUIRE. THEY ADVISED ME TO FORWARD ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO THEIR INSURER, WHO IN TURN ADVISED ME TO FORWARD ALL CORRESPONDENCE TO THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL. THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL HAS NOW ADVISED ME THAT THEY ADMIT NO LIABILITY AND HAVE DONE NO WRONG AND THAT THEY WILL NOT ENGAGE IN FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE. I HAVE REMINDED ORTHOPEDIATRICS OF THEIR DISREGARD TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE US CODE OF REGULATIONS, TITLE 21, 803 AND OF THEIR DISREGARD TO THEIR OWN CODE OF ETHICS REGARDING TRANSPARENCY AND CO\u00ad OPERATION WITH INVESTIGATIONS. I HAVE THREATENED THEM WITH REPORTING THEM TO THE US FDA AND THE (B)(6), BUT STILL I HAVE NO INFORMATION FROM THEM. THE SURGEON WHO DID THE OPERATIONS ADVISES ME THAT THERE IS/WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINEERING OF THE SURFACES OF THE COCR RODS AND ALSO THE TORQUING TECHNIQUE USED TO SECURE THE RODS TO THE SCREWS. THE SURGEON RECENTLY ADVISED THAT ORTHOPEDIATRICS HAVE SINCE ISSUED A NEW TOOL FOR THIS SURGICAL PROCEDURE THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE DURING MY SON'S SURGERY. MY RESEARCH OF THIS MATTER LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE. I BELIEVE THAT IF A PROBLEM WITH THE QUALITY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN MY SON'S SURGERY IS AT ALL SUSPECTED, THEN AT THE VERY LEAST, TRADING AND USE OF THE COMPONENTS IN QUESTION SHOULD BE SUSPENDED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY CAN BE RE-ESTABLISHED AS SAFE AND THAT ORTHOPEDIATRICS CAN CONFIRM THAT THERE IS NO RISK. ORTHOPEDIATRICS' REFUSAL TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE CLEARLY REGARDING PATIENT SAFETY AND WELLBEING IS DEPLORABLE WHETHER THEY ARE AT FAULT OR NOT. I HOPE YOU CAN GET TO THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR ME PLEASE."

THE AIM OF THIS CASE REPORT IS TO DESCRIBE THE OCCURRENCE AND SALVAGE OF AN L1 CHANCE FRACTURE OCCURRING THROUGH THE LOWER INSTRUMENTED VERTEBRA (LIV) FOLLOWING PEDICLE SCREW PLACEMENT FOR POSTERIOR SPINAL INSTRUMENTED FUSION IN THE TREATMENT OF AIS. THIS CASE SHOWS THAT THERE MUST BE DUE CONSIDERATION OF THE SMALL PEDICLE AT L1 WHEN IT IS CHOSEN AS THE LIV. REPORTED EVENTS: 1. INSTRUMENTED POSTERIOR SPINAL FUSION WITH PEDICLE SCREWS IS THE MOST COMMONLY EMPLOYED SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS (AIS). IN LENKE TYPE 1 OR 2 CURVES, L1 IS COMMONLY THE LOWEST INSTRUMENTED VERTEBRA (LIV); HOWEVER, THE L1 VERTEBRA HAS SMALL PEDICLES WHICH CHALLENGES ITS SAFE INSTRUMENTATION. SURGERY. HERE IS THE CASE OF A PATIENT TREATED WITH POSTERIOR SPINAL FUSION FOR AIS WHO SUSTAINED A CHANCE FRACTURE AT L1 FOLLOWING T2\u00bfL1 POSTERIOR INSTRUMENTED FUSION FOR AIS. 2. A PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A LENKE 1B DEFORMITY COMPLAINING OF BACK PAIN AND A FEELING OF LEANING TO THE RIGHT. EXAMINATION SHOWED AN ELEVATED RIGHT SHOULDER, RIGHT TRUNK SHIFT AND NORMAL NEUROLOGY. A DIAGNOSIS OF AIS AND A RECOMMENDATION FOR POSTERIOR SPINAL FUSION OF T2\u00bfL1 WAS MADE BASED UPON BENDING RADIOGRAPHS. NO PRE-OPERATIVE CT SCAN WAS CARRIED OUT. THE PATIENT WAS ADVISED OF THE RISKS OF CONSTRUCT FAILURE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR REVISION SURGERY. 3. LEGACY TITANIUM (MEDTRONIC MINNEAPOLIS, MN) INSTRUMENTATION WAS USED WITH FIXED ANGLE SCREWS PLACED AT T3\u00bfL1, AND POLYAXIAL SCREWS PLACED AT T2. THE LOCATION OF EACH SCREW WAS CONFIRMED WITH ELECTROMYOGRAPHY. THERE WERE NO INTRAOPERATIVE CONCERNS WITH PEDICLE SCREW POSITION OR SIZE, AND NO FRACTURE OR PERFORATION OF THE PEDICLE WAS NOTED. POST-OPERATIVE RADIOGRAPHS SHOWED A RESIDUAL MAIN THORACIC CORONAL CURVE AND SATISFACTORY SAGITTAL ALIGNMENT. 48\u00b0. THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE OR EARLY COMPLICATIONS. 4. AT 6 MONTHS POST-OPERATIVELY, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF PAIN IN THE LOWER BACK AND AN ASSOCIATED BUMP. RADIOGRAPHS SHOWED NEW LUMBAR KYPHOSIS BETWEEN T12 AND L2 CONSISTENT WITH A CHANCE FRACTURE AT L1. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT EXTENSION OF FUSION TO L3 AND MADE AN UNEVENTFUL RECOVERY. AT 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, THE PATIENT IS WELL AND PARTICIPATING IN UNRESTRICTED SPORTS. THE FOLLOWING DEVICE SPECIFICS WERE PROVIDED: LEGACY TITANIUM (MEDTRONIC MINNEAPOLIS, MN) INSTRUMENTATION WAS USED WITH FIXED ANGLE SCREWS AND POLYAXIAL SCREWS SEE ATTACHED LITERATURE ARTICLE."

PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITH A TWENTY MINUTE DELAY. THERE WAS NO PATIENT CONSEQUENCE. THIS REPORT IS FOR A ROD, 480 MM THIS IS REPORT 5 OF 7 FOR (B)(4)."

UPON AWAKING, THE PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE HER FEET. SHE WAS EXTUBATED AND BROUGHT TO THE POST ANESTHESIA UNIT FOR FULL WAKE-UP. SHE HAD SENSATION OF HER LEGS BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THEM. SHE HAD AN EMERGENT CT SCAN THAT SHOWED 3 PEDICLE SCREWS IN THE SPINAL CANAL. SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE OR TO HAVE THE SCREWS REMOVED. SHE CONTINUED TO HAVE INCOMPLETE PARAPLEGIA AFTER SURGERY, INCLUDING A LOSS OF BOWEL AND BLADDER CONTROL. SHE WAS TREATED WITH DECADRON AND KETOROLAC. SHE REGAINED SOME MOVEMENT IN HER LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY AND WAS REPORTING BLADDER FULLNESS AND THE SENSATION TO VOID. LAST REPORT IS THAT THE PATIENT IS AT HOME WALKING WITH CRUTCHES, USING A WHEELCHAIR WHEN FATIGUED. RANGE OF MOTION ON HER RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY IS NEARLY NORMAL BUT STILL LACKS STRENGTH. HER BLADDER CONTROL IS IMPROVING, WITH LESS RETENTION WHEN VOIDING, BUT STRAIGHT CATHETERIZATIONS ARE STILL REQUIRED."

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE MANY BIOLOGICAL, MECHANICAL AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL FACTORS WHICH AFFECT THESE DEVICES BUT CANNOT BE EVALUATED IN VIVO, THE COMPONENTS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO INDEFINITELY WITHSTAND THE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND LOADS OF NORMAL HEALTHY BONE. FATIGUE FRACTURE OF SPINAL FIXATION DEVICES, INCLUDING SCREWS AND RODS, HAS OCCURRED.\" CONCLUSION: THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE IS FATIGUE FRACTURE DUE TO LENGTH OF IMPLANTATION."
